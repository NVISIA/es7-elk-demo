# ElastcStack 7 - ElasticSearch, Logstash and Kibana Demonstration

# Elasticsearch Docker File

The folder src/main/docker contains the docker compose script for Elasticsearch, Kibana and Logstash. Here are a few notes related to the script:

* Using the latest version of Docker, 18.09.2, build 624796
* To support running Elasticsearch, I updated the configuration for Docker to use 2 CPUs and 6GB of memory.
* To run the container from the top folder of this project, simply execute:
```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/elasticsearch.yml up
```

# Kibana Access

Once the Docker containers have been started up from the elasticsearch script, you can access Kibana from the following URL:

http://localhost:5601/app/kibana


# CustomerPortal Project

The CustomerPortal project was generated by JHipster and is one of the two projects to show how data can be logged and aggregated into Elasticsearch.

# EmployeePortal Project

The EmployeePortal project was generated by JHipster.
